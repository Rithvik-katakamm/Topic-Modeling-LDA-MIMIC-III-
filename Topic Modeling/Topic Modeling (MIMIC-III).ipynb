         "Admission Date:  [**2183-9-25**]       Discharge Date: [**2183-10-29**] Service: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The following discharge summary will cover the time period from [**10-15**] through [**2183-10-28**]. Please see previous discharge summary for information on patient's admission diagnosis and medications. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  Gastrointestinal.  On [**10-16**] the patient developed nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  Because of this she was not discharged to rehabilitation at [**Location (un) 511**] Center Hospital as had been previously planned.  Due to her symptoms a CT scan was obtained which revealed the patient had an ileus. There were no abscesses or other processes that could be identified.  The neurology service was consulted regarding possibility of this ileus being related to the patient's myopathy but felt this was unlikely since skeletal muscle myopathies typically do not also involve smooth muscle of the Gastrointestinal tract.  A Gastrointestinal consult was obtained who had no additional thoughts on what could be causing the patient's ileus and recommended bowel rest. The patient was kept off tube feeds for two days after which time they were restarted at a low rate of 20 cc's an hour as compared to her goal rate of 65 cc's per hour.  The patient appeared to tolerate this reasonably well and the tube feeds were increased.  When they reached the rate of 30 cc's an hour however the patient developed nausea and vomiting a second time.  Tube feeds were again stopped and her bowel was rested for several days. On [**10-24**] it was decided that because the patient was unable to tolerate tube feeds at a reasonable rate she would be started on TPN for nutrition.  At the time of this dictation on [**10-27**] the patient was reporting decreased abdominal pain and no further nausea or vomiting.  She additionally had been successful in moving her bowels and treated with Colace, Senokot and Fleet enemas.  The suspicion of the team at this point in time is that her ileus is resolving however, very slowly.  Her tube feeds will need to be started at a very slow rate, advanced extremely gently as tolerated with caution being taken because when the rate is increased to abruptly she does tend to develop nausea and vomiting.  She will be discharged out on no tube feeds, they can be started when she arrives at [**Location (un) 511**] Center for rehabilitation. She will be discharged out on TPN which she can continue. Additionally we will maintain her on [**Doctor Last Name **] and Colace. 2.  Pulmonary.  The patient continued to do well on a trach mask and in fact tolerated trach mask ventilation for five days in a row with no support from mechanical ventilator. Because of this she was deemed safe to go to the floor something which the team and the patient's family were very happy with as it was thought this could be a trial preliminary to transferring her to rehabilitation home.  On [**10-21**] she was transferred to the floor. Unfortunately however, on [**10-22**] she was found to be hypoxic to the low 80's on the floor.  She was suctioned with thick tenacious dark secretions came out, her O2 sats increased to the mid-80's. Chest x-ray was consistent with a left sided opacity throughout which was new.  She was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit with ventilatory support and bronchoscopy was performed which revealed purulent drainage from the left mainstem, sample was sent.  Chest x-ray after bronchoscopy revealed markedly improved air space.  O2 saturations increased to 98% on only .4 FIO2.  Following this episode the patient was rested in IMV for several days.  At the time of this admission she was feeling better and feeling strong enough to try pressor support ventilation again. The teams thinking is that perhaps the patient needs to be rested each night in an MV mode letting her use only a trach mask for five days may have been to much to soon and in the future we will get her to tolerate pressor support and rest her on the night and possibly during the day allowing her to breath through the trach mask.  Currently she is being weaned, this will need to be continued at [**Hospital1 **]. Per discussion with the family the pulmonary attending is planning to call the pulmonary attending at [**Hospital1 **] to communicate the patient's need regarding ventilatory management. 3.  Infectious disease.  On [**10-16**] the patient's urine grew out Enterobacter which was sensitive only to Mirpenum and one other [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  She was treated with Mirpenum for seven days. At approximate completion of the 7 days course the patient's BAL sample from her bronch grew out pseudomonas which was resistant to Mirpenum.  Because of this switched to Zosyn which the pseudomonas was sensitive to.  She will be discharged on this and need to complete a 10 to 14 day course.  Additionally she was started on Flagyl for possible C. diff given that she was complaining of abdominal pain and was feeling extremely weak.  Of note, she did not have diarrhea.  She did seem to get better after starting the Flagyl so she will need to complete a 14 day course of this as well for empiric therapy for C. diff. Also of note the patient had one set of blood cultures positive for coag negative staph however, it was deemed that this was a contaminant and the decision was made not to treat after consultation with Infectious Disease service. 4.  Neurological.  The patient continued to show improvement in her strength while on 60 mg of Prednisone a day.  The original plan had been for her to be treated for 4 weeks with 60 mg of Prednisone empirically and then follow-up with the neuromuscular service for a decision as to whether or not to continue this.  However, after approximately 2-1/2 weeks of therapy the patient had issues with infectious disease as detailed above including urinary tract infection and pulmonary infection.  Because of these issues, with highly resistant bacteria it was deemed that the best thing to do would be to taper the steroids. On approximately [**10-22**] the patient was cut from 60 to 40 mg of Prednisone a day and on [**10-27**] the day of this dictation the patient was cut to 20 mg a day.  She will need to continue this slow taper until the steroids had been weaned to off. If her improvement in neurologic function continues even off the steroids then she can probably never start on steroids again however, if she shows a decline once she is off steroids this will further enforce the theory that the steroids are what has been treating her myopathy and once she is clear for infectious issues she should be restarted on steroids in the future.  She will follow-up with the neuromuscular service as detailed in her previous discharge summary. 5.  Psychiatric.  On one occasion the patient during the night the patient became quite despondent and request that she did not wish to continue with this therapy as she was incredibly frustrated.  However, the team had multiple discussions on their rounds and at the time of this dictation the patient's mood had significantly improved and her will to fight on actually seemed quite remarkable.  She is continued on her Paxil and at the present time the team did not see any need for additional psychiatric intervention. 6.  Communication.  A family meeting was held on [**2183-10-27**] with the patient's two daughters, son and husband as well as the attending physician in the Intensive Care Unit Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the former Intensive Care Unit attending, myself Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 916**] and the patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Discussion was held as to the patient's status.  We discussed the fact that the family had previously wished for the patient to have resolution of all her issues prior to going to rehabilitation.  However, we explained that her issues seemed to be taking quite sometime the resolve and that we will have to accept the fact that her issues are stable and improving although not completely resolved.  Additionally was discussed the fact that the patient was clearly ready for rehabilitation now and likely many of her problems including her pulmonary and gastrointestinal problems may benefit from getting her out of bed and having her go to rehabilitation. The family was open to this and grateful for our assistance. Tentative plans were made to arrange for discharge to [**Hospital1 5593**] on [**2183-10-29**]. An addendum to this discharge summary will be dictated following this detailing the events of the 15th and 16th. Please refer to that discharge summary for the exact meds at discharge and discharge diagnosis. DIAGNOSIS AT TIME OF THIS DICTATION: 1.  Respiratory failure resulting in ventilatory dependence. 2.

         "Admission Date:  [**2183-9-25**]       Discharge Date: [**2183-10-29**] Service: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The following discharge summary will cover the time period from [**10-15**] through [**2183-10-28**]. Please see previous discharge summary for information on patient's admission diagnosis and medications. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  Gastrointestinal.  On [**10-16**] the patient developed nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  Because of this she was not discharged to rehabilitation at [**Location (un) 511**] Center Hospital as had been previously planned.  Due to her symptoms a CT scan was obtained which revealed the patient had an ileus. There were no abscesses or other processes that could be identified.  The neurology service was consulted regarding possibility of this ileus being related to the patient's myopathy but felt this was unlikely since skeletal muscle myopathies typically do not also involve smooth muscle of the Gastrointestinal tract.  A Gastrointestinal consult was obtained who had no additional thoughts on what could be causing the patient's ileus and recommended bowel rest. The patient was kept off tube feeds for two days after which time they were restarted at a low rate of 20 cc's an hour as compared to her goal rate of 65 cc's per hour.  The patient appeared to tolerate this reasonably well and the tube feeds were increased.  When they reached the rate of 30 cc's an hour however the patient developed nausea and vomiting a second time.  Tube feeds were again stopped and her bowel was rested for several days. On [**10-24**] it was decided that because the patient was unable to tolerate tube feeds at a reasonable rate she would be started on TPN for nutrition.  At the time of this dictation on [**10-27**] the patient was reporting decreased abdominal pain and no further nausea or vomiting.  She additionally had been successful in moving her bowels and treated with Colace, Senokot and Fleet enemas.  The suspicion of the team at this point in time is that her ileus is resolving however, very slowly.  Her tube feeds will need to be started at a very slow rate, advanced extremely gently as tolerated with caution being taken because when the rate is increased to abruptly she does tend to develop nausea and vomiting.  She will be discharged out on no tube feeds, they can be started when she arrives at [**Location (un) 511**] Center for rehabilitation. She will be discharged out on TPN which she can continue. Additionally we will maintain her on [**Doctor Last Name **] and Colace. 2.  Pulmonary.  The patient continued to do well on a trach mask and in fact tolerated trach mask ventilation for five days in a row with no support from mechanical ventilator. Because of this she was deemed safe to go to the floor something which the team and the patient's family were very happy with as it was thought this could be a trial preliminary to transferring her to rehabilitation home.  On [**10-21**] she was transferred to the floor. Unfortunately however, on [**10-22**] she was found to be hypoxic to the low 80's on the floor.  She was suctioned with thick tenacious dark secretions came out, her O2 sats increased to the mid-80's. Chest x-ray was consistent with a left sided opacity throughout which was new.  She was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit with ventilatory support and bronchoscopy was performed which revealed purulent drainage from the left mainstem, sample was sent.  Chest x-ray after bronchoscopy revealed markedly improved air space.  O2 saturations increased to 98% on only .4 FIO2.  Following this episode the patient was rested in IMV for several days.  At the time of this admission she was feeling better and feeling strong enough to try pressor support ventilation again. The teams thinking is that perhaps the patient needs to be rested each night in an MV mode letting her use only a trach mask for five days may have been to much to soon and in the future we will get her to tolerate pressor support and rest her on the night and possibly during the day allowing her to breath through the trach mask.  Currently she is being weaned, this will need to be continued at [**Hospital1 **]. Per discussion with the family the pulmonary attending is planning to call the pulmonary attending at [**Hospital1 **] to communicate the patient's need regarding ventilatory management. 3.  Infectious disease.  On [**10-16**] the patient's urine grew out Enterobacter which was sensitive only to Mirpenum and one other [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  She was treated with Mirpenum for seven days. At approximate completion of the 7 days course the patient's BAL sample from her bronch grew out pseudomonas which was resistant to Mirpenum.  Because of this switched to Zosyn which the pseudomonas was sensitive to.  She will be discharged on this and need to complete a 10 to 14 day course.  Additionally she was started on Flagyl for possible C. diff given that she was complaining of abdominal pain and was feeling extremely weak.  Of note, she did not have diarrhea.  She did seem to get better after starting the Flagyl so she will need to complete a 14 day course of this as well for empiric therapy for C. diff. Also of note the patient had one set of blood cultures positive for coag negative staph however, it was deemed that this was a contaminant and the decision was made not to treat after consultation with Infectious Disease service. 4.  Neurological.  The patient continued to show improvement in her strength while on 60 mg of Prednisone a day.  The original plan had been for her to be treated for 4 weeks with 60 mg of Prednisone empirically and then follow-up with the neuromuscular service for a decision as to whether or not to continue this.  However, after approximately 2-1/2 weeks of therapy the patient had issues with infectious disease as detailed above including urinary tract infection and pulmonary infection.  Because of these issues, with highly resistant bacteria it was deemed that the best thing to do would be to taper the steroids. On approximately [**10-22**] the patient was cut from 60 to 40 mg of Prednisone a day and on [**10-27**] the day of this dictation the patient was cut to 20 mg a day.  She will need to continue this slow taper until the steroids had been weaned to off. If her improvement in neurologic function continues even off the steroids then she can probably never start on steroids again however, if she shows a decline once she is off steroids this will further enforce the theory that the steroids are what has been treating her myopathy and once she is clear for infectious issues she should be restarted on steroids in the future.  She will follow-up with the neuromuscular service as detailed in her previous discharge summary. 5.  Psychiatric.  On one occasion the patient during the night the patient became quite despondent and request that she did not wish to continue with this therapy as she was incredibly frustrated.  However, the team had multiple discussions on their rounds and at the time of this dictation the patient's mood had significantly improved and her will to fight on actually seemed quite remarkable.  She is continued on her Paxil and at the present time the team did not see any need for additional psychiatric intervention. 6.  Communication.  A family meeting was held on [**2183-10-27**] with the patient's two daughters, son and husband as well as the attending physician in the Intensive Care Unit Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the former Intensive Care Unit attending, myself Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 916**] and the patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Discussion was held as to the patient's status.  We discussed the fact that the family had previously wished for the patient to have resolution of all her issues prior to going to rehabilitation.  However, we explained that her issues seemed to be taking quite sometime the resolve and that we will have to accept the fact that her issues are stable and improving although not completely resolved.  Additionally was discussed the fact that the patient was clearly ready for rehabilitation now and likely many of her problems including her pulmonary and gastrointestinal problems may benefit from getting her out of bed and having her go to rehabilitation. The family was open to this and grateful for our assistance. Tentative plans were made to arrange for discharge to [**Hospital1 5593**] on [**2183-10-29**]. An addendum to this discharge summary will be dictated following this detailing the events of the 15th and 16th. Please refer to that discharge summary for the exact meds at discharge and discharge diagnosis. DIAGNOSIS AT TIME OF THIS DICTATION: 1.  Respiratory failure resulting in ventilatory dependence. 2.

         "Admission Date:  [**2184-1-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2184-1-20**] Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 79-year-old woman is admitted for respiratory distress, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.  This woman has had a complicated medical course over the past six months which has included several episodes of respiratory failure, difficulty to wean off a ventilator, tracheostomy placement complicated by tracheal tear (requiring open sternotomy), anasarca, atrial fibrillation, E.coli sepsis, pseudomonas urinary tract infection, VRE intraabdominal abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis.  Her ventilatory difficulties were thought to be perhaps secondary to a myopathic process, although muscle biopsy results were inconclusive and not demonstrative of inflammatory changes. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**10-28**] through [**2183-12-18**] and successfully weaned from the ventilator there.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 5595**] [**2183-12-18**] where she was gradually reintroduced to p.o. feed and weaned from PEG feeds.  She currently tolerates a pureed diet.  Her atrial fibrillation has been managed via rate control as the Amiodarone she was previous on was felt to possibly contribute to her myopathy.  She had been on Lasix (40 mg b.i.d.) on transfer from [**Hospital1 **] and nonetheless gained 12 pounds from [**12-28**] through [**1-15**].  Lasix was decreased to 20 mg q. day on [**1-12**] because her sodium was noted to be 129. On [**1-15**], the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea and tachypnea.  She states she has had intermittent dry cough for several days.  No subjective fevers or chills. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] today with still more dyspnea / tachypnea, sodium of 126 and a potassium of 6.2. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Hypertension. 2.  Atrial fibrillation. 3.  Diastolic dysfunction (latest echo [**2183-9-30**] ejection fraction of 70 to 80% (2+ aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation). 4.  History of intubations, tracheal tear secondary to tracheostomy, myopathic contribution to respiratory difficulty. 5.  E.coli sepsis. 6.  VRE abscess. 7.  Klebsiella pneumonia. 8.

Captopril 25 mg q. eight hours. 6.  Metoprolol 25 mg q. 12 hours. 7.  Levothyroxine 75 mcg q. day. 8.  Digoxin 0.125 mg q. day. 9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 10. Senokot one tab b.i.d. ALLERGIES: 1.  Aspirin. 2.  Gentamycin. 3.  Vancomycin. SOCIAL HISTORY:  Twenty pack year smoking history.  Son, [**Name (NI) **], cardiologist in [**Location (un) 5583**]. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for rash present since [**12-30**] at [**Hospital1 5595**]. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 97.4 F, heart rate 96, blood pressure 143/68, respirations 20 and oxygen saturation 88% on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils 2 mm, light reactive.  Sclerae anicteric. Oropharynx dry.  Lungs:  Bilateral end expiratory wheezes. Heart:  Regular rate, irregularly irregular rhythm, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex to the axilla.  Abdomen: Soft, mild diffuse tenderness, J tube site non-erythematous, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  2 cm bilateral pitting edema to mid thigh bilaterally.  Skin:  Reticular erythematous blanching and rash bilaterally upper extremities and trunk.  Neuro:  Alert and appropriately interactive. LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.7, hematocrit 34.0, platelets 319.  INR 3.3, PTT 41.1.  Sodium 125, potassium 6.4, chloride 84, total CO2 31, BUN 25, creatinine 0.6, glucose 119. Arterial blood gas:  7.38 / 58 / 91. Chest x-ray:  Dense left retrocardiac opacity, small bilateral pleural effusions. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted for treatment of pneumonia.  This was felt to be the main etiology of her respiratory distress.  She had a Levofloxacin allergy on my medical record, but per patient and daughter, she did not have an allergy.  She was placed on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. day for a 10 day course.  Her respiratory status subsequently improved and returned to her baseline level of saturating in the 90s on zero to two liters of oxygen per nasal cannula.  She was monitored for additional rash and no rash appeared.  Her previous rash symptomatically improved throughout admission. The patient had evidence of a urinary tract infection on urinalysis.  A culture was performed which was contaminated. Additional culture and sensitivities are recommended if the patient has continued symptoms despite her course of Levofloxacin. 2.  ELECTROLYTES:  Aforementioned, the patient had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on admission.  She was noted to be extravascularly volume overloaded and intravascularly depleted by physical examination.  Potential etiologies of this were felt to include diastolic cardiac dysfunction and malnutrition with hypoalbuminemia.  The patient received one liter of normal saline at a slow rate.  Thereafter, she was fluid restricted.  Her sodium improved to a level of 129 on the day prior to discharge.  The patient's potassium likewise improved to a level under 5.  A cosyntropin stimulation test was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency.  The test was negative. 3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Aforementioned, the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation and possibly with diastolic dysfunction.  Her Metoprolol was increased to 37.5 mg p.o. B.i.d. for improved rate control.  Her Captopril was also increased to 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.  She was continued on Digoxin as her son noted that the patient diuresis well in response to this drug.  She remained in atrial fibrillation with good rate control throughout admission. 4.  NUTRITION:  The patient has a recent history of malnutrition.  A nutrition consult was obtained for tube feed recommendations as the patient has had decreased p.o. intake of late.  She received nocturnal tube feedings with encouraged p.o. intake throughout the day.  It is recommended that her nutritional status be closely monitored at [**Hospital1 5595**] as this contributes to her general well-being. 5.  ENDOCRINE:  Patient has noted history of hypothyroidism. TSH was pending at time of this dictation.  She was continued on her outpatient dose of Synthroid throughout admission. 6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on Coumadin at admission for her atrial fibrillation.  She had an elevated INR on day #1 of admission and her Coumadin was held.  It is recommended that her INR be monitored in an outpatient setting with adjustments made to maintain an INR between 2 and 3. 7.  PSYCH:  Patient has apparent depression with depressed mood and neurovegetative symptoms.  She was continued on Wellbutrin SR this admission.  It is recommended that she have a trial of Ritalin once she returns to [**Hospital1 5595**] for activation and appetite stimulation. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Pneumonia. 2.  Atrial fibrillation. 3.  Diastolic dysfunction. 4.  Depression. 5.  Malnutrition. 6.  Hypothyroidism. 7.  Retrosternal goiter. 8.  History of respiratory failure and multiple difficult intubations. 9.

Tumor is felt most likely with central necrosis, although typically, central necrosis has homogeneous T2 hyperintensity centrally whereas this lesion demonstrates T2 isointensity. A complex hemorrhage is a possibility, although the CT obtained at outside institution demonstrates that this mass is not hyperdense, in a patient with anemia, it is possible that the density may be diminished. Possibly, both may be the case, a tumor with complex hemorrhage. Abscess is considered less likely given that centrally the lesion is hypointense on diffusion with peripheral slow diffusion. 2. Multifocal confluent and FLAIR hyperintensities are present within the periventricular and subcortical white matter without restricted diffusion or gradient signal artifact likely representing the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. C/A/P CT [**4-12**] - 1. Left upper lobe soft tissue mass with coarse calcification, associated traction bronchiectasis, and calcified hilar nodes. Additionally pleural calcification can be seen in prior asbestos exposure. There is underlying emphysema. These findings are worrisome for malignancy, though prior granulomatous infection might also have this appearance. Correlation with further studies (e.g. PET-CT, and/or biopsy) is recommended. 2. There is no evidence of malignancy of the abdomen or pelvis. Head Ct [**4-13**] - 1. Status post resection of a left parietal mass with expected post-surgical sequelae including pneumocephalus as well as some blood products within the surgical bed. 2. Layering pneumocephalus along the left frontal cerebral hemisphere with adjacent mass effect. 3. Ventricles appear more prominent on today's study compared to MRI of [**2103-4-12**], concerning for early ventriculomegaly. Recommend followup CT to monitor. 4. Extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities, more prominent on the left versus the right are relatively unchanged since MRI Brain MRI [**4-14**] - 1. Status post resection of left parietooccipital mass with blood products at the surgical site without definite residual enhancement. Pneumocephalus is seen and expected post-surgical changes seen at the surgical site. 2. Linear area of restricted diffusion, extending deeper from the surgical site to the left periatrial region could represent an area of ischemia adjacent to the surgical site. Clinical correlation recommended. 3. Changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy. No other enhancing brain lesions. Brief Hospital Course: Admitted to Neurosurgery for workup of new Left parietal lesion.  Coumadin and aspirin were held on admission.  MRI with and without Gadolinium revealed only the one solitary left parietal lesion and therefore the decision was made to resect the lesion.  Steroids were held for the possiblity of lymphoma.  Concern for metastatic prostate CA to the brain was low, however CT chest/Abd/Pelvis was performed for oncological workup. Chest/Abd/Pelv CT obtained on [**2103-4-12**] demonstrated a LUL mass with calcifications and b/l hilar adenopathy.  On [**2103-4-13**], patient underwent left-sided craniotomy and ressection of the left parietal mass. He was extubated without incident and transferred to SICU for management.  His ICU course was uneventful.  His post-operative CT and MRI showed post operative changes without evidence of new acute hemorrhage.  He was trasnferred to the floor in stable condition. During his course on the floor, patient had persistent hypertension. He was started on amlodipine 5mg with minimal response. Medicine was consulted for Hypertension management. Additionally, Thoracic surgery and neuro oncology were consulted regarding the LUL mass and brain mass, respectively.  He was transfered to the medicine service for further evaluation and management.  The remainder of his course was as follows: # Left parietal mass/left upper lung mass/likely new cancer diagnosis: Patient and wife aware that mass likely represents a cancer, most likely metastatic lung cancer, though not certain as pathology is pending at time of discharge.  Dexamethasone was tapered off.  Keppra was started for seizure prophylaxis and should be stopped 10 days following discharge.  Pathology of the mass will be followed-up as an outpatient.  Patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in neuro-oncology, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in thoracics, and medical oncology in the thoracic oncology clinic.  He will also need a PET/CT scan as an outpatient for further evaluation and staging of his disease.  Please see discharge paperwork regarding the appointments that need to be scheduled when he arrives at rehab.  Additionally, he will require PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] on discharge from rehab. # Hypertension: BP was elevated post-op (160 and higher) and improved on amlodipine and tapering of the dexamethasone.  He was also continued on his home regimen of metoprolol, prazosin, and nitroglycerine patch.  BP was 110-130 on day of discharge. If blood pressure drops further, decrease amlodipine to 2.5 mg daily. # Urinary incontinence/retension and E. coli urinary tract infection: Patient has a history of urinary retension and incontince and straight caths himself multiple times per day (~[**4-27**]).  His urine culture grew >100K E. coli, pan-sensitive. He also had an elevated WBC count.  He was started on ceftriaxone on [**4-16**] and is being discharged on cefpodoxime.  He should have a total 14 day course for complicated UTI and will need 12 additional days on discharge.  Foley catheter was removed and regular straight cathing Q3-4 hours per home regimen was reinstated to reduce risk of reinfection and promote ambulation. # Atrial fibrillation: Stable.  Patient remained rate controlled on home regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol.  Warfarin was stopped due to craniotomy and can be restarted on [**2103-4-21**].  He should have his INR checked on [**4-24**] and every other day until his warfarin dose and INR are stabilized.  Goal INR is 2.0-3.0. # Coronary artery disease: Stable.  Metoprolol and statin continued.  Aspirin was held.  It should be restarted on [**2103-4-21**]. # Obstructive sleep apnea - Patient was continued on CPAP per home regimen. # Prostate cancer - Patient was continued on bicalutamide.  He also receives goserelin injections from his urologist. # Glaucoma - Continued timolol and lantanoprost eye drops # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen while on pain medications that should be weaned off. # Code: Full # Communication: Patient, HCP [**Name (NI) 3516**] [**Name (NI) 5598**] (wife) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5599**] On day of discharge, patient is afebrile and vital signs are stable.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital following a fall and found to have a mass in your brain.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], your neurosurgeon, removed this mass and the pathology to determine exactly what it is, is still pending, though it is most likely some form of cancer.  You were also found to have a mass in the left upper lobe of your lung.  We have scheduled some specialist follow-up appointments for you and additional appointments still need to be scheduled.  These appointments are important to make sure that you receive prompt evaluation and treatment for your condition.  Please be sure to make and go to all appointments. The following changes were made to your medications: START Keppra 500 mg twice a day (for seizure prophylaxis).  You should stop this medication 10 days after you leave the hospital. START Cefpodoxime 200 mg every 12 hours (for urinary tract infection) for 12 more days. START Amlodipine 5 mg daily for blood pressure.  If your blood pressure drops below 115 systolic, this medication can be stopped. START oxycodone 5 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.  While you take this medication, STOP ultram.  As your pain gets better, you can stop the oxycodone and go back to ultram. START colace, senna, and miralax as needed to prevent constipation STOP Skelaxin.  You seemed to do okay without this medication. START heparin for clot prophylaxis until your INR is therapeutic or you are moving enough at rehab to prevent clots. You can RESTART your aspirin and warfarin on [**2103-4-21**].  Please get your INR checked on the 4th day thereafter and at least every other day until your INR and warfarin dose are stable. Goal INR is 2.0-3.0.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:   Pt. has a L UE AV fistula that is pulsatile and aneurysmal. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1058**] would like   a fistulagram to assess for any outflow stenoses that need to be angioplastied.   Pt. last had an intervention of his long cephalic outflow stenosis and cephalic   arch lesion in [**4-22**].  ______________________________________________________________________________                                  FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)  PROCEDURE:  1.  Fistulagram of left antecubital fossa AV fistula.  2.  Balloon angioplasty of the venous outflow segment.  3.  Placement of purse-string suture around access site.  HISTORY:  61-year-old man with end-stage renal disease with pulsatile left  upper extremity AV fistula with suspicion for venous outflow obstruction.  ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of  Versed (3 mg) and fentanyl (150 mcg) throughout the total intraservice time of  1 hour 10 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were  continuously monitored.  In addition, 1% lidocaine was administered to the  skin overlying the left antecubital fossa access point.  RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 152**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 153**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 753**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 754**] performed  the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 754**], the attending radiologist, was present and  supervised the entire procedure.  PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Informed consent was obtained outlining the risks and  benefits of the procedure involved.  Following this, the patient was brought  to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.  The left  upper limb was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A  preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.  Ultrasound confirmed satisfactory flow within the region of the arterial  anastomosis with the fistula.  Ultrasound was again used to identify an  optimal access point.  Following administration of 1% lidocaine to the skin,  the fistula was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  A 0.018 nitinol wire  was advanced proximally into the aneurysmal venous component.  A 4 French  micropuncture sheath was then advanced over the wire.  Using this access, a  digital subtraction angiogram was performed which demonstrated two significant  contiguous aneurysms in the proximal venous segment just distal to the  AV anastamosis with multiple areas of focal stenosis in the outflow vein as  well as a long segmental stricture/stenosis in cephalic vein just proximal                                                              (Over)  [**2158-1-27**] 9:26 AM  AV FITULOGRAM SCH                                               Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 80915**]  Reason: Pt. has a L UE AV fistula that is pulsatile and aneurysmal.

The angiogram also  demonstrated a patent arteriovenous anastomosis.  A decision was made to  perform balloon angioplasty.  An 035 Glidewire was used to navigate the wire  into the SVC. The 4 French sheath was removed and replaced with a 6 French  short [**Last Name (un) 169**]-Tip sheath.  A 5 French Kumpe catheter was then advanced over the  Glidewire and used to exchange for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire. Over the [**Doctor Last Name 539**] wire, the  outflow vein was dilated in its entirety using a 6-mm balloon. A repeat  digital subtraction angiogram demonstrated significantly improved diameter and  flow in the outflow vein.  There were some persistant areas of stenoses more  central, proximal to the cephalic vein inflow into the left subclavian vein.  The decision was made to repeat the venoplasty using an 8-mm balloon. This  plasty demonstrated residual areas of stenosis which were successfully  dilated.  Again, a repeat digital subtraction arteriogram demonstrated  satisfactory flow through this venous fistula into the central veins.  A 0  silk suture was applied to form a pursestring surrounding the 6 French sheath  which was removed and the pursestring tied. Good hemostasis was achieved and  manual pressure was maintained for 10 minutes.  The patient tolerated the  procedure well and there were no early complications.  IMPRESSION:  Digital subtraction angiogram demonstrates multiple areas of  stenosis throughout the outflow venous segment of the left antecubital fossa  AV fistula.  There is good inflow from the arterial anastomosis.  The areas of  stenosis were successfully plastied using 6-mm and 8-mm balloons.  There were  no early complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  If the  stenoses recur, consideration should be given to the use of a cutting balloon.  The staff radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 754**], has reviewed the images and the report. "

Chest X-Ray [**2167-2-28**]: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. The etiology of the blunting of the left costophrenic angle is indeterminate. Conceivably, it could represent small focal anterior loculated effusion or possibly a subsegmental atelectasis. . CT abd/pelvis [**2167-3-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Large soft tissue lesions through the mesentery, retroperitoneum, inguinal areas and lower mediastinum concerning for large lymph nodes, presumably in setting of CLL. Splenomegaly. 2. Cholelithiasis. 3. Bilateral small pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, could be atelectasis. 4. No evidence of abdominal aorta dissection. Moderate atherosclerotic changes in the abdominal aorta and its branches. 5. Diffuse osseous sclerosis, could be seen in the renal osteodystrophy or related to CLL. . PET CT scan: [**2167-3-9**] IMPRESSION: 1. Large soft tissue lesions through the neck, mesentery, retroperitoneum and inguinal areas concerning for large lymph nodes, presumably in setting of CLL since no FDG uptake above normal tissues is seen. 2. Increased FDG uptake in several hilar lymph nodes, subcarinal lymph node and soft tissue at the left lung base near the mediastinum (difficult to tell if mediastinal lymph node or within the lung); concerning for focal [**Doctor Last Name **] transformation. 3. Splenomegaly. 4. Cholelithiasis. 5. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities, could be atelectasis in setting of pulmonary edema. 6. Diffuse osseous sclerosis, could be seen in the renal osteodystrophy or related to CLL. Note: There is suggestion of metabolic imbalance; we are not seeing uptake in the kidneys and there is decreased uptake in the brain. Also, due to diffuse anasarca and third spacing, the resolution on low-dose CT is particularly poor. . CXR [**2167-3-10**]: FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of [**2167-3-7**]. A previously described right internal jugular central venous line remains in unchanged position. A new right-sided PICC line is identified and the tip is seen to terminate in almost similar position as the other line, i.e. in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. No pneumothorax has developed. The PICC line is difficult to identify on the native chest examination, however, a special contrast-enhanced copy conclusively demonstrates termination point close to the previously existing line as described. . Tissue immunophenotyping [**2167-3-3**]: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a Kappa light chain restricted monotypic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, consistent with patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma.  Review of the concurrent blood smear reveal increased prolymphocytoid cells; Atypical larger lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear contours and prominent nucleoli are noted, suggestive of transformation.  Clinical correlation and bone marrow biopsy study is recommended. . Tissue immunophenotyping [**2167-3-13**]: pending Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 3012**] is a 69 y/o male with a history of ESRD on HD, CLL, DM2 c/b peripheral neuropathy, CAD and anemia (baseline 20-23) who presented with worsening shortness of breath and fatigue, transferred to MICU for hypotension, improved with aggressive IV hydration, then transferred to the floor where he was dialyzed and was evaluated for possible CLL/SLL conversion to lymphoma. . # Hypotension: He triggered the night after admision ([**2167-3-1**]) for hypotension with SBP in the 70's, was started on Vanco/[**Hospital 35453**] transferred to MICU.   There he was extremely fluid responsive with >10L IVF given.  Norepinephrine was initially used, then weaned.  Working diagnosis included hypovolemic shock vs distributive shock, although no infectious source was identified.  Antibiotics continued for 3 days.  He was gradually restarted on beta blocker and alpha blocker while on the floor. He had no recurrences of hypotension while on the medical [**Hospital1 **]. . # ESRD: HD schedule is Mon, Wed and Fri. He was dialyzed as per schedule with additional ultrafiltration to help diurese the large fluid load he received due to hypotension.  Sevelamer was stopped due to low phosphorus.  Continued on nephrocaps.  Lasix held because per recs from his outpatient providers.  He will resume darbopoetin weekly upon discharge.  At discharge, he is still hypervolemic, but anasarca has significantly improved and pulmonary edema has significantly improved (no oxygen required). . # Anemia: Multifactorial etiologies including renal failure, dilution and potentially CLL/SLL.  He received 4 units PRBC total during admission with appropriate response in hematocrit. There was no evidence of hemolysis.  He will resume darbopoetin weekly upon discharge.  His hematocrit should be checked every 3 days at rehab until it has stabilized. . # CLL/SLL: CT abdomen showed large intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, initially concerning for [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] syndrome. Flow cytometry was sent which was consistent with known CLL/SLL, although there was some concern over prolymphocytes seen on smear.  He subsequently received a PET CT which showed FDG avid uptake in hilar nodes but not intra-abdominally.  LDH remains normal, which suggests against conversion to lymphoma.  However, because hilar nodes were concerning on PET CT, he received bronchoscopy with hilar lymph biopsy [**2167-3-13**].  There were no immediate complications to the procedure.  The pathology and immunophenotyping will be followed by hematology/oncology and the patient has follow up scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] to discuss results and initiate treatment should this be lymphoma. . # Hypertension: His blood pressure have been stable since IVF resuscitation. Restarted metoprolol in exchange for nebivolol on day of transfer from MICU.

    "In this project, I preprocessed a set of clinical notes from the MIMIC-III dataset using a combination of regex cleaning and spaCy's lemmatization. I then converted the cleaned text into a bag-of-words representation and applied LDA to extract five distinct topics. The topics that emerged were focused on key clinical themes—namely, Assessment and Plan, CT Imaging/Radiology, Medication Dosage and Lab Measurements, Chest Radiology Reports, and Pediatric/Infant Care. With a coherence score of about 0.595 and a perplexity of -7.21, the model produced moderately coherent topics that align with real-world clinical documentation. These results show that even a basic topic modeling approach can help uncover meaningful patterns in clinical notes, offering a solid foundation for further analysis and integration with additional patient data."
